json-cls

Generate Cach√© classes from json documents.
The purpose of this is to allow one to effiecently use JSON documents within the 
Ensemble pipeline. The generated classes can be used in request/response messages, business rules,
or data transformation.

From a terminal session you can generate a class like this:

<code>
ENSDEMO>read json
{ "name" : "Johnny Jones", "age" 45, "email" : { "work" : "jj@acme.com", "home" : "j23@email.com" } , "cars" : [ "Fiat", "Chevy", "Mazda", "Volvo" ] }

ENSDEMO>do ##class(jsoncls.Generator).Generate("foo.person",json)
</code>

This would then generate a class called foo.person.
